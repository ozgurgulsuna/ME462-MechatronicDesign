# ME462-MechatronicDesign
This is a repository of the course ME462 Mechatronics design spring 2021-22. The project is conversion of 6x6 radio controlled car into ROS compatible reseach platform. This includes placing various sensors around the car, environment avareness and ultimately localization and autonomous navigation in outdoor environments.

## Branching
There are three branches on this repository. 
* main branch : Its synchronized for all developers and a middle step before implementing on the car.
* jetson branch : The version of the firmware and various supplements running on NVIDIA Jetson Nano.
* commandcenter branch : A branch dedicated to the command module on the "ground base" with higher computational power to support SLAM and Navigaiton packages to run.
